# Probability Distribution for Wind Velocity

This is a data analysis performed using Python in which the main goal is to evaluate the probability disribution used in the wind energy field of study, as well as obtaining some important characteristics regarding the wind potential in the chosen location, considering measurements from a LIDAR for 40 and 140 meters of height.

P.S. : The code still doesn't have all the comments necessary to a easy understanding, I am still going to insert them when I have the chance.
